<!-- # Bio -->

I am now a third-year PhD candidate at School of Computer Science, Fudan University.
My Ph.D. thesis is jointly-supervised by [Prof. Peng Wang](https://pengwang511.github.io/project.html) at Fudan Univ. and [Prof. Themis Palpanas](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~themisp/) at UniversitÃ© Paris CitÃ©.
I enjoy working with labmates of [DSM Group](https://github.com/DSM-fudan) and [diNo Research group](https://dino.mi.parisdescartes.fr/) at the same time.
Before that, I got my bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science from Fudan University in 2021.

I have published papers in top conferences and journals of database and data mining, including SIGMOD, VLDB, VLDB Journal and TKDE. I also serve as the reviewer of peer-reviewed journals including TKDE. 


My research interest lies in the management and analyses of massive complex data, including:

1) High-dimensional vector indexing for approximate nearest neighnor search (ANNS)

2) Data series / time series similarity search and analyses

3) Other important issues on high-dimensional data management (e.g., storage, compression)

4) DB + AI: RAG, learned index, learned query optimizer, learned index tuning, etc.

Welcome to contact me via [zeyuwang21@m.fudan.edu.cn] if you are interested in me and my research works.

Welcome to subscribe my [Medium](https://medium.com/@caucherw) to discuss the exciting ideas in data management!

My [Chinese tech blog](https://www.jianshu.com/u/d015902c6d09) records my detailed comments on academic papers and advanced techniques.

My MBTI is INTJ.
