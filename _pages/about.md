<!-- # Bio -->

I am now a third-year PhD candidate at School of Computer Science, Fudan University.
My Ph.D. thesis is joint-supervised by [Prof. Peng Wang](https://pengwang511.github.io/project.html) at Fudan Univ. and [Prof. Themis Palpanas](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~themisp/) at UniversitÃ© Paris CitÃ©.
I enjor working at [DSM Group](https://github.com/DSM-fudan) of Fudan Univ. and [diNo Research group](https://dino.mi.parisdescartes.fr/) of UPC at the same time.
Before that, I got my bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science from Fudan University in 2021.

I have published papers in top conferences and journals of database and data mining, including SIGMOD, VLDB, VLDB Journal and TKDE. I also serve as the reviewer of peer-reviewed journals including TKDE. 
I'm hornoed to be invited to publish a survey paper in the prestigious IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin, special issue on [High-Dimensional Similarity Search: from Time Series Management Systems to Vector Databases](http://sites.computer.org/debull/A23sept/issue1.htm).

My research interest lies in the management and analyses of high-dimensional data, including:

1) High-dimensional vector indexing for approximate nearest neighnor search (ANNS)

2) Data series/Time series similarity search and analyses

3) Other important issues on high-dimensional data management (e.g., storage, compression)

4) High-dimensional indexes for AI applications (e.g., Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG))

Welcome to contact me via [zeyuwang21@m.fudan.edu.cn] if you are interested in me and my research works.
