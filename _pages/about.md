I am now a third-year PhD candidate at Fudan University, majoring in computer science.
My Ph.D. thesis is joint-supervised by [Prof. Peng Wang](https://pengwang511.github.io/project.html) at Fudan Univ. and [Prof. Themis Palpanas](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~themisp/) at Université Paris Cité.
I enjor working with labmates at [DSM Group](https://github.com/DSM-fudan) at Fudan Univ. and [diNo](https://dino.mi.parisdescartes.fr/) at UPC at the same time.
Before that, I got my bachelor’s degree in computer science from Fudan University.

I have published papers in top conferences and journals of database and data mining, including SIGMOD, VLDB, VLDB Journal and TKDE. I'm hornoed to be invited to publish a surver paper in the prestigious IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin, special issue on [High-Dimensional Similarity Search: from Time Series Management Systems to Vector Databases](http://sites.computer.org/debull/A23sept/issue1.htm).

My research interest lies in the management and analyses of high-dimensional data, including:

1) High-dimensional vector indexing for approximate nearest neighnor search (ANNS)

2) Data series similarity search

3) Intrinsic distribution and correlation mining on high-dimensional data

4) Compression on high-dimensional data

5) Broad applications of high-dimensional indexes, e.g., Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)


My MBTI is INTJ.
